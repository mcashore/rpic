RPic is a plugin for Chrome that will show you pictures from your favourite
subreddits whenever you ask for them.

No longer navigate to your subreddit, click an image, click back, click an image,
click back, click an image, click back, etc, etc.

With RPic you can procrastinate more stealthily and efficiently.
